<dc:description>PRODUCE, CONSUME, INVEST.
Quarantine gifted us with time (or better, gave us back time). What to do with this time has been clear to many: produce something new; consume all those media pending; invest time to improve your abilities. But I rediscovered the beauty of wasting time. I love dancing and I always try to improve myself, but not this time: in this photo I was just having fun with automatic shutter. I didnâ€™t want to produce a nice photo, I wanted to fix in memory the time I was marvelously wasting.</dc:description>
